    <div class="content-box" translate="" > Dashain: Elder relatives and friends give children pocket money and a blessing in
        the form of a tika, a sticky red paste that is sometimes mixed with rice and applied on the forehead. The Jamara
        seeds that were planted on the first day will have matured by now, and the plants are taken and used as one of
        the main ingredients. This day strengthens the bonds of the community and connects generations. </div>
        
    <div class="two">Tihar: Both Tihar and Diwali are known as "the festival of lights", as they are celebrated with lit
        lanterns called diyas which are placed inside and outside homes and there are firework shows. Diwali is a time
        of renovation and prayer, so people clean up their homes and meet their families for feasts,
        gifts and prayers, although the exact rituals depend on the region. The lights represent the victory of
        knowledge and hope over ignorance and despair, and therefore of good over evil.</div>
    <div class="one">Holi: This is the day when people apply colours to one another, party and enjoy. Children and
        youngsters play in groups with dry colours called abir or gulal, pichkaris (water guns), water balloons filled
        with coloured solutions and other creative things. You might even find groups of people with drums and other
        musical instruments on streets, dancing and singing their way from one place to another.</div>
    <div class="two">Maghe Sankranti: Special foods are cooked in this festival. Till ko ladoo (Brown Sesame seed
        Fudge), Chakku (Molasys), Ghee (Clarified Butter). Spinich and Yams curry is cooked as Maghe Shankrantis
        special food. It is believed that massaging the body with Sesame oil and eating these foods helps us become
        healthier and keep us warmer during the cold weather.</div><br>
